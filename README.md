Erythromycin has been recorded in coastal waters and could suppose a severe threat to marine microbial life, as this pharmaceutical has been found at high concentrations in natural aquatic media. Macrolides such as erythromycin may affect microalgae by inhibiting the pathways involved in protein synthesis. 
Toxicological testing on microalgae has proven to be a useful tool for the risk assessment of a substance in phytoplanktonic organisms. Due to controversial results among microalgae species sensitivity to erythromycin found in the literature,  the  main goal of this work was to assess the sensitivity to erythromycin of different marine microalgae under the same conditions. For this purpose, we chose eight species representing the main taxonomic groups: two green algae, four heterokonts, one haptophyte and one dinoflagellate. Our results show a wide range of sensitivities consistent with those found in the literature, This indicates that biological and not methodological differences were primarily responsible for the observed variation. The second goal was to elucidate the biological causes underlying the observed differences. For this purpose, we characterized different ecotoxicological endpoints (growth, cellular properties and activity of photosynthetic apparatus), and investigated their phylogenetic distribution on the eukaryotic host phylogeny, the chloroplast phylogeny, and the gene trees of molecules functionally relevant to the toxic mechanism.  We found that the growth response distribution was best explained by the topology of the 23S rRNA gene tree when modeled following a non-stationary evolutionary process. This novel approach is a step forward in the development of sensitivity models accounting for the phylogeny and ecotoxicity of the contaminants.
